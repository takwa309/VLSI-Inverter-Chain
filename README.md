# VLSI Project – Inverter Chains & Transmission Gate

##  Description
This project presents the design and simulation of **digital VLSI circuits** using **SPICE**:

1. **Chain of three inverters using pseudo-NMOS technology**  
2. **Chain of three CMOS complementary inverters**  
3. **CMOS transmission gate (pass-transistor logic)**

The project demonstrates circuit modeling in SPICE, delay and timing analysis, and comparison between pseudo-NMOS and CMOS inverters with consideration of load capacitance effects.

##  Technologies & Tools
- **SPICE** (.sp files) – circuit description and simulation  
- **LTspice ** – simulation environment  
- **VS Code** – code editing
